Thread will reset at daily reset (3:00 - anakin skywalker is the chosen one - dark side currently has a superior advantage in HVV and GA - anakin skywalker is the chosen one - the community overall has been asking for a strong, yet balanced hero, to combat dark side’s op-ness - anakin skywalker is the chosen one Let’s not cry for nerfs right when anakin comes out pls I’m really looking forward to giving dark side a proper taste of their own medicine. I think my daughter might be a mutant. Thing is, I'm not sure I can afford bringing her to the Xavier Institute. I want her to be in a place where she can be safe and accepted, but just by googling pictures of the place it looks like some high-end private school. How much do you think is the tuition fee there. Moonlight Angelica S1: chance to slow S2 (passive): Will of the Goddess When a debuff is inflicted on an allied hero, the combat readiness of the caster is increased by 25%. At the beginning of the caster's turn, all debuffs currently on the caster are dispelled. S3 (active): Sacred Prayer Dispels all debuffs from all allies, replacing it with Continous Healing for 2 turns, and granting Immunity for 2 turns. Just for those that haven't heard yet, from the official EA Star Wars on Facebook: >These are our two hero vehicles you can acquire during the battle. Rebels will have access to the X-wing and A-wing. Imperials can chose between the TIE fighter and TIE Interceptor. Restarted playing Pokémon GO the other day (after a nearly 3 year break. Played before released and stopped shortly after official release ahahaa) There's a feature I'd like to describe here as it is directly tied to my suggestion: Pokémon Buddy In PoGO, a pokémon buddy is a pokémon that can accompany you to gather a candy of that specific pokémon. Candies are used in varying numbers to evolve a pokémon. You gather candies upon reaching specific kilometer threshold - for example, every. Before All Might retired the top 3 heroes were: All Might Flame Hero: Endeavour Winged Hero: Hawks So All Might is close to Deku he gave him his power. Endeavour is close to Todoroki he is his father anyways. Hawk isin't actually related to any of those two. Now the future number one hero will obviously be Deku, since his adult form said in the very first episode: 'This is the story of how I became the Number One Hero.' The number two hero is harder to determine because

If others can contribute to this post, that would be appreciated, share your wisdom. This is my opinion on the heroes that are available for picking. ----------- Trickster The obvious popular choice. He can have great DPS as a mage as well as have the ability to chaos. He's great mainly with Neonrex and Custodian. Some people will say he's not all that good because.

Hi, first post here so don't judge me too harshly I noticed that Hero Academia is exclusively Japan-focused, which is great but also allows for a lot of world-building beyond that country. So I came up with an idea; what if there was a international tournament (or Sports Festival) where heroes in training from all over the globe compete? Think of Little League Baseball for example. Thinking of this, I came up with Seven ideas for international heroes. I did it based upon the four top-performin. Let us play all 3 lanes at the same time. I wouldn't suggest something this crazy if I didn't feel like it could benefit the game. Could. I can be dead wrong, so hear me out. There's a number of things I've seen people say about Artifact that feel like compromises. One of them is Time and this is the important one so I'll be upfront on this point because it's the one I like to see discussion one. A lot of people think that Artifact is a slow game. Early game has a lot of dead rounds. I wanted to ask the subreddit how they felt,I've been playing since season 1 and I still enjoy the game in it's current patch,I think goats can be interesting as another way to play the game and at least in the diamond-low masters SR group it isnt meta or game breaking as players own mistakes as well as having dps heros to combat and pick at a distance making the game still fun and explosive. I've been playing the game for 2 years and I still feel like I have more to learn and improve Santa Muerte - when a single attack is inflicted on an earth elemental hero, decrease Combat Readiness by 10% Will need confirmation on whether it works on golem. Equip 3 thieves with high speed and Santa Muerte along with a healer with debuff cleanse or immunity and one unhealable required. Example team: cidd haste Surin lots Contstantly hit golem and pushback so that golem only ever hits with counters Credit to u/allucky for the idea feel free to comment on what could be improved Who’s the best light side hero to combat against an ass playing the Emperor. 
I am not going to post a wall of text, there's honestly no need for it. Ask yourself these 3 questions: Does this game have an unacceptable amount of bugs? How long have these bugs existed? Are things getting better or worse with each new update? Servers/netcode/tickrates are unacceptable for a FPS. Hero/melee combat is full out broken. Movement/dodging could use work. What do I want do achieve with this post? Enough with the content for a while, seriously, just chill after Anakin. My thoughts on Ace Combat 4. (https://www.reddit.com/r/acecombat/comments/9lb2xq/so_i_decided_to_play_this_holy_trinity_you_guys/) My thoughts on Ace Combat Zero.
