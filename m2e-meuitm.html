I've spent most of my Mass Effect time on consoles, and have recently moved to PC. I installed MEUITM and some other texture mods, which were a great improvement. However, it seems that for some reason the high res textures are gone. If anything it seems to be worse than the game's default. Can I get MEUITM up and running again without a total uninstall/re-install. So I've had the trilogy games and all the DC on my 360/XBX1 forever now.

So i just bought the trilogy on Origin. Now I'm looking for the essential mods, that are stable. I intend to record my play through to video, so I can play with editing the story into an episodic form. I want ME1 to look as on par with ME2-3 as possible.

As the title suggest, I need help. My laptop is old and while it can handle the regular ME, it can't handle the updated textures for the mod. I deleted what I could (the file and saves in Documents/Bioware) and even did the whole "verify game" thing you can do on Steam, but the game still looks. weird. That and I still get the "loading custom shaders" thing when the game is starting up. What was it that I missed and need to delete? Any help to get back to the vanilla game would be greatly.

Second, is there a way to replace the bonus power options, since I won't have access to them starting over. Finally, I had all of the "Friend of" achievements on the Xbox for ME 1, all of which give useful bonus abilities. Especially Wrex's, which gives a bonus to health regen. Is there a way to replace.
